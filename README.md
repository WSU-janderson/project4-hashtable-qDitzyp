# Project 4 - HashTable

Project description can be found [in the repo](Project4_HashTable.pdf)

Place your complexity analysis below.

---

# insert

The time complexity of this would be 0(n), because the time would increase with the size of the list, and the availability spaces, it would also be based on the pseudo random probe.

---
# remove

This would be the same as the insert function.

---
# contains

This would be the same as the other two, as it would need to search through the buckets using the probe.

---
# get

This would also be the same as contains, as it's essentially the same in use, it just returns the value instead of a boolean

---
# operator
